RAML Syntax Highlighter
=======================

This is a simple syntax highlighter for the RESTful API Modeling Language (http://raml.org/). It was designed for Sublime Text 2, but should work for Sublime Text 3.

RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) is a simple and succinct way of describing practically-RESTful APIs. It encourages reuse, enables discovery and pattern-sharing, and aims for merit-based emergence of best practices.

##File associations

With this package, Sublime Text will recognize `raml` files as having RAML syntax.

##Installation

The easiest way to install is to just copy the `sublime-package` file (bundled with the [releases](hhttps://github.com/restful-api-modeling-lang/raml-sumblime-plugin/releases)) to the `Installed Packages` folder of your personal Sublime Text folder.

For Windows users, that's likely located in `%appdata%\Sublime Text 2`.

Alternatively, you can find it by going to Preferences > Browse Packages, and then going up one folder.

You could also install by copying the files into a `Sublime Text 2\Packages\RAML` folder (making the `RAML` folder).
